            <h2>New Project: Raspberry Pi Pico W for Steam Generator Control</h2>
            <p>This project implements a new Raspberry Pi Pico based control for a Leisure Steam One Touch LS series steam generator. The factory control PCB was misbehaving, and I have wanted to implement an automatic self-flush to clean the tank, so I thought it would be a good challenge to replace it with a Raspberry Pi Pico. This is my first MicroPython project. I was originally implementing this system in C, but when I started down the path to connect a Pico W to WiFi, I decided to try out MicroPython and I was blown away by the power and rapid development/test cycles. I mostly think this project might be interesting to people because of a few new ideas that I have not seen documented well in the wild:</p>

            <h2>Example Project: Google Sheets Data Logger</h2>
            <p>There are many ways to log data, but few are as easy, powerful, and free as Google Sheets. Originally, I was developing an app to log current and water depth data from a sump pump system in a basement using *.csv files. I thought it would be neat to have the data directly sent to a Google Sheet, having the graphs automatically update. It was actually easier than I expected, but I did think a few steps were poorly documented. So here it is, a step-by-step easy example of logging data from a Raspberry Pi running node.js directly to a Google Sheet.</p>

            <h2>Example Project: Calendar Scraper for Time-Based Actions</h2>
            <p>Handling time and date-based events sucks. Calendars are complicated and change, and daylight savings time comes and goes. Originally, I was developing an app to schedule my spa heater around time-of-use (TOU) electric rates. The TOU rates change with season, on weekends and holidays. At first, I was using the cron daemon, but it was a real pain to make exceptions or change anything.</p>
            <p>I was thinking that the only interface Iâ€™ve ever liked is Google Calendar; so why not just use Google Calendar? So here it is, less than 100 lines of Node.js that scrapes a Google calendar and translates the calendar events into Javascript setTimeout(). Gets the function call down to <.01 s on a Raspberry Pi W2.</p>

            <h2>Last Project: Elan System6 Control with Raspberry Pi</h2>
            <p>A GPIO Bit Banging / RS-485 Interface to an Elan System6 Integrated Multi-Zone Controller using a Raspberry Pi.</p>
            <p>I have an Elan S6 multi-zone audio controller in my house and I love it. I wanted to be able to control it via my phone! The plan was to get a Raspberry Pi to bit bang the protocol. The project was a success, but did need some custom circuitry, which is described in the GitHub repository.</p>
