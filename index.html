 <h1>New Example Project: <a href="https://github.com/jeremyrode/CalendarScraper"> Calendar Scraper: Perform Time-Based Action via Scraping a Google Calendar </a></h1>
  <p> Handling time and date-based events sucks.  Calendars are complicated and change, daylight savings time comes and goes.  Originally, I was developing an app to schedule my spa heater around time-of-use (TOU) electric rates.  The TOU rates change with season, on weekends and holidays.  At first, I was using the cron daemon, but it was a real pain to make exceptions or change anything.</p>
  <p> I was thinking that the only interface Iâ€™ve ever liked is Google Calendar; so why not just use Google Calendar?  So here it is, less than 100 lines of Node.js that scrapes a Google calendar and translates the calendar events into Javascript setTimeout().  Gets the function call down to <.01 s on a Raspberry Pi W2.</p>

  <p>A GPIO Bit Banging / RS-485 Inteface to a Elan System6 Integrated Multi-Zone Controller using a RaspberryPi</p>
  <p>I have a Elan S6 multi-zone audio controller in my house and I love it.
    I wanted to be able to control it via my phone!  The plan is to get a RaspberryPi to bit bang the protocol.</p>
  <p>The project was a sucess, but did need some custom circuitry, which is described in the github repositoy.</p>
