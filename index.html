  <p>A GPIO Bit Banging / RS-485 Inteface to a Elan System6 Integrated Multi-Zone Controller using a RaspberryPi</p>
  <p>I have a Elan S6 multi-zone audio controller in my house and I love it.
    I wanted to be able to control it via my phone!  The plan is to get a RaspberryPi to bit bang the protocol.</p>
  <p>The project was a sucess, but did need some custom circuitry, which is described in the github repositoy.</p>
