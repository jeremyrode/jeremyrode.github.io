 <h1>New Rasberry Pi Pico W Project: <a href="https://github.com/jeremyrode/PicoSteamControl"> Pico Steam Control </a></h1>
   This project implements a new Raspberry Pi Pico based control for a Leisure Steam One Touch LS series steam generator.
The factory control PCB was misbehaving, and I have wanted to implement an automatic self-flush to clean the tank, 
   so I thought it would be a good challenge to replace it with a Raspberry Pi Pico.
This is my first MicroPython project. I was originally implementing this system in C, but when I started down the path to 
   connect a Pico W to WiFi, I decided to try out MicroPython and I was blown away by the power and rapid development/test cycles.
I mostly think this project might be interesting to people because of a few new ideas that I have not seen documented well in the wild:</p>

  
 <h1>New Example Project: <a href="https://github.com/jeremyrode/GoogleSheetsDataLogger"> Google Sheets Data Logger: Log Data Directly to Google Sheets </a></h1>
  <p>There are many ways to log data, but few are as easy, powerful, and free like Google Sheets. Originally, I was developing an app to log current and water depth data from a sump pump system in a basement using *.csv files.
    I thought it would be neat to have the data directly sent to a Google sheet, having the graphs automatically update. It was actually easier than I expected, but I did think a few steps were poorly documented.
  So here it is, a step-by-step easy example of logging data from a Raspberry Pi running node.js directly to a Google Sheet.</p>


  
 <h1> Example Project: <a href="https://github.com/jeremyrode/CalendarScraper"> Calendar Scraper: Perform Time-Based Action via Scraping a Google Calendar </a></h1>
  <p> Handling time and date-based events sucks.  Calendars are complicated and change, daylight savings time comes and goes.  Originally, I was developing an app to schedule my spa heater around time-of-use (TOU) electric rates.  The TOU rates change with season, on weekends and holidays.  At first, I was using the cron daemon, but it was a real pain to make exceptions or change anything.</p>
  <p> I was thinking that the only interface Iâ€™ve ever liked is Google Calendar; so why not just use Google Calendar?  So here it is, less than 100 lines of Node.js that scrapes a Google calendar and translates the calendar events into Javascript setTimeout().  Gets the function call down to <.01 s on a Raspberry Pi W2.</p>

<h1>Last Project: <a href="https://github.com/jeremyrode/elancontrol">
  Elan Control</a>
  </h1>
  <p>A GPIO Bit Banging / RS-485 Inteface to a Elan System6 Integrated Multi-Zone Controller using a RaspberryPi</p>
  <p>I have a Elan S6 multi-zone audio controller in my house and I love it.
    I wanted to be able to control it via my phone!  The plan is to get a RaspberryPi to bit bang the protocol.</p>
  <p>The project was a sucess, but did need some custom circuitry, which is described in the github repositoy.</p>
